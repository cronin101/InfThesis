\subsection{Recap of motivations for research}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvements in sequential execution performance are lacking, thus a switch to parallelism is necessary.

\item There is a lack of software developers sufficiently experienced with parallel programming.

\item Without parallel execution of code, much of the potential throughput of a modern system is wasted.

\item Easing parallelisation of primitives will let novice developers achieve greater device utilisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brief description of proposed solution}
The proposed solution is a plug-in library that allows certain standard-library functions to be automatically executed in parallel, without complicating the calling code.
This will allow investigation into the advantages of naively distributing computation over multiple compute-units.

By remaining as similar as possible to standard library code, and requiring no prior knowledge of parallel program construction, novice users will be able to benefit from any increased throughput.

The produced library should be assessed on ease-of-use and performance. Clearly demonstrating the benefits of the library will allow developers to recognise if and when its inclusion would be beneficial to a personal project.
