\subsection{Recap of motivations for research}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvements in sequential execution performance are lacking, thus a switch to parallelism is necessary.

\item There is a lack of software developers who are sufficiently experienced with parallel programming.

\item Without parallel execution of code, a large portion of the potential throughput present in a modern system is wasted.

\item Easing the parallelisation of primitives will let novice developers achieve greater device utilisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brief description of proposed solution}
The proposed solution is a plug-in library that allows certain standard-library functions to be executed in parallel, automatically, without complicating the calling code.
This will allow investigation into the advantages of algorithmically distributing computation over multiple compute-units.

With the project's deliverable remaining as similar as possible to standard-library code, and requiring no prior knowledge of parallel program construction, novice users will be able to benefit from any increased throughput.

The produced library should be assessed on ease-of-use and performance. Clearly demonstrating the benefits of the library will allow developers to recognise if and when its inclusion would be beneficial to a personal project.
