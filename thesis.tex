\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank the project's supervisor, Stratis Viglas, for providing technical guidance throughout the project's lifetime.

I would also like to thank my final-year flatmates, James Hulme and Jacob Essex. They both worked far too hard over the course of this year and were a significant motivation, as I strived to keep up with their relentless pace of study.
